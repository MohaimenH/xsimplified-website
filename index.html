                X, Simplified is a passion project which intends to explore the
                benefits of coding to anyone unfamiliar with the subject.
                Non-STEM students are taught how to use coding for their tasks
                without diving too deep into unrelated computer science
                concepts. Moreover, it assists kids in starting their coding
                journey.
            </p>

            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
                Each intakes are split into sessions, whereby a number of
                students are selected. We work with these students, teaching
                them the ropes and promoting collaboration every step of the
                way.

                Each month we decide to focus on one language and cater to a specific use case.
                This month we will do another session of "Python for Everybody". This will serve as a very basic introduction to Python.
                Anybody and everybody is welcome to join in.
            </p>

            <p>The registration link will be added here very soon, so keep an eye out! The sessions are scheduled to start from July 21st, 2021.</p>
