        <p class="headline">Welcome to X, Simplified.</p>
        <p class="desc">X, Simplified is a passion project which intends to explore the benefits of coding to anyone unfamiliar with the subject. 
            Non-STEM students are taught how to use coding for their tasks without diving too deep into unrelated computer science concepts.</p>
        <p class="desc">Moreover, it assists kids in starting their coding journey. Each intakes are split into sessions, whereby a number of students are selected. 
            We work with these students, teaching them the ropes and promoting collaboration every step of the way.</p>
        <p class="session">The next session, Python for Everyone, is scheduled to start on June 28th. Unfortunately, all spaces have been filled.</p>
